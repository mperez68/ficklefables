## SUMMARY
In **Fickle Fables**, you will grow a small village from the wealth of a gold mine in the center of town, slowly unraveling the story around the mysterious dissapearance of a princess from these lands.

## PURPOSE
This project is a 30 day challenge to finish a functioning prototype for the month of April 2025. This year I hope to keep up this trend and finish 12 prototypes, 1 a month.
